Lab 1a - Installing a Web Server on Zenit

Objective:

To install a web server on the zenit server. This is a two stage process. Lab 1a will complete the Apache Installation. Lab 1b given in Week 3 with reinstall the web server with the PHP module, so remember these instructions.

(2 Marks) To be completed by Week 3 start of lab period.

1. Login to your zenit account
2. Make a directory in your home directory called apache. This is your server root.
3. Change to the /tmp directory
4. Make a directory with your zenit username and change into it
5. Using lynx download the tarball for 2.2.31

lynx http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

6. Unpack the tarball.

tar zxvf *31.tar.gz

7. Change directories to the httpd directory that was created. (called the source root)

8. Configure the source code for installation

./configure --prefix=/home/yourzenitusername/yourserverroot

Substitute the appropriate directory pathname and ensure it is an absolute pathname

9. Compile the install

make

10. Install the executable

make install

11. Change to the server root in your home directory

12. Change your permission sets

chmod 700 bin logs conf includes modules 
chmod 711 cgi-bin

13. Change to the conf directory

14. Read the ports file in your home directory for the port numbers listed, and write these two numbers down

15. In conf, open up httpd.conf in vi and search for the Listen directive. Change the number to the first number you received in the ports file.

16. Write the file and quit

17. Change to the bin directory in your server root

18. Start the server

./apachectl start

19. Test your server. Open a browser and go to

zenit.senecac.on.ca:yourportnumber

where portnumber is the number you enter in httpd.conf

20. Your done!!!
Optional for students that have done a linux install on a VM or hard drive.

Objective: To install the raw source executable for PHP5.4.45 with Apache-2.2-31.

This will allow student to run the Apache Web server with the the PHP module on zenit, customized for that environment. This requires some modifications to the install procedure from the Install instructions in both Apache and PHP.

The install notes for php Installation are located here 
Please be aware that the install directions do not reflect the changes made for zenit.

1. Shut down your Apache web server as per Lab 1a or using the kill -9 <PID#>

2. Remove your server root from your home:

rm -rf <serverroot>

replacing serverroot what you named it

3. Create a new serverroot in your home directory as per lab 1a

4. Again, move to the /tmp directory in the root of zenit. Make a directory with your username. Once made, move to it.

5. Using lynx, as in Lab1a, get the tarball for apache, and for PHP. I found this link could handle lynx for the php download.

http://fossies.org/linux/www/php-5.4.45.tar.gz
or
http://php.net/get/php-5.4.45.tar.gz/from/a/mirror

www.php.net is the main source link

6. Unpack the tarballs with the tar zxvf command

7. We will configure the apache first. Go into the source directory of apache:

8. Now, install Apache again with one change, from Lab 1a. Move to the apache source directory (httpd-2.2.31)

9. Re-do the re-configuration

./configure --prefix=/home/yourhomedirectory/yourserverroot --enable-so

make
make install

10. Return to your home directory

11. Go to your server root and the conf directory


12. Open up httpd.conf in vi and put in your port number 

13. Got to the directives listed as FilesMatch (around line 223)

14. Insert a new directive with the following:

<FilesMatch "\.ph(p[2-6]?|tml)$">

 SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
  
</FilesMatch>
15. Save and quit


16. Start your server and check it with a browser then stop it again.

17. Install php Go to the php source root


./configure --with-apxs2=/home/yourusername/yourserverroot/bin/apxs --with-mysqli --prefix=/home/yourusername/yourserveroot

18. Prepare the install and install it

make
make install

19. Restart your server

20. Write a php file by going into the server root and cgi-bin directory.

21. Create a php test page with the phpinfo function of PHP by opening a file
in vi and call it admin.php

22. Insert the following text:

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

23.Change the permission on admin.php to 755

24. Test it by going to that page.

http:/zenit.senecac.on.ca:yourportnumber/cgi-bin/admin.php

25. That's it.
